Damn! For a minute there it seemed like Chuang Hing was taking over as king. But now I'm not so sure. Here's the thing with Wai Ling: service is a 3, maybe 3.5. The fries are a 4, Max. But the wings? The wings, my G, are a 10. There's something about their batter that's different from every other chinese chicken wing I've eaten. Its thicker, has a noticeable crunch. And sweeter. Its almost like they use cornmeal or something in there to get that extra-hearty, sweet crunch. Whatever it is... their wings have the most original flavor. Just like that we're introducing a new category: Succulence. Wai Ling gets a 5.
