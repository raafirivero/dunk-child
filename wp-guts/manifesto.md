<h2 class="deal"><span>Here's the Deal</span></h2>

If you hate it when you're on some site and they're like this dope <del datetime="2014-01-21T15:13:01+00:00">-X-</del> is coming out on <del datetime="2014-01-21T15:12:28+00:00">-X-</del>. Only it never comes out. Or it's so "exclusive" it was never really for sale in the first place. Or you click to buy and it's not available. Keep reading.

If you’re anything like us, you visit blogs daily checking out the latest in music, sports, and style. It's not a thing like, "oh I'm the most up-on-shit cat in the world," but it's not the other way either. It's regular.

The problem is that staying up on shit can get in the way of actually <strong>being the shit</strong>. QED.

We dig snapbacks. And fitteds. And 5-panels. But  we're too busy making money, getting chicks, and generally living our lives to care what came out when and how to be the first dude in line for the dope new <del datetime="2014-01-21T15:15:46+00:00">-X-</del>.

They need to just send us the shit when it's ready.

<strong>The Tops Club</strong> is for when you want that RAW, but don't have time to spend every waking hour searching it out. We do the work, you get the benefit.

We scour the web for the best headwear every season. Then, you get an email from us. These are the dopest snapbacks and 5-panels that are out now, pick one. None of that wondering when it's gonna come out. None of that fake shit. We select the best stuff, you choose, and we send it to you. Boom.
